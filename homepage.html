        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This site was created to hold memories of my past saves from the Sims 4. Some of the images come from
          saves I no longer have access to. These images also show my improving skill in creating Sims.</p><br>
        <small>Not to brag but I think my Sims have gotten cuter</small>
        <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
        <p>On the side of this page is the navigation menu.</p> <p>To look at specific family photos click on the <span class="imptext">Families</span>
        link. After going to the Families page, you then can pick what family photos you would like to look at.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The <span class="imptext">Random</span> link will take you to look at photos of Sims I only have a few photos of and don't belong to a specific family.
        Due to the fact I haven't played with them long enough.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The <span class="imptext">About</span> link will tell you more about myself (the site creator) and how I play the Sims 4.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The <span class="imptext">Packs</span> link shows all the expansion, game, and stuff packs that I own.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I really hope you find this website enjoyable. This site is for me to show others the photos I have taken in the Sims 4.</p>
